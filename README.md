## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Bootstrap 5
- Javascript



### What I learned
I have learned a lot of things in this project like how to use "Bootstrap" and "CSS Grid".  
I learned about "Media Query Breakpoints", which are used to implement a particular CSS styling on the specific conditions. Like if the screen is bigger than 750px use this set of styling etc.
Tryed to implement some good programming practices :-
1. Readability
2. Modularity
3. Efficiency
4. Length

Some code snippet for fun ðŸ˜€:

```html
<h1>A New Different Way To Improve Your Skills.</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: studywithLearning;
}
```
```js
const learning = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```



### Continued development

I want to learn more about "CSS Grid" and "Bootstrap" and also want to learn more about "Media Query Breakpoints" and "Refracting a code".
